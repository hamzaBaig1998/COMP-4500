# Brief
In the year 2205, robots had taken over all human tasks and humans were confined to their homes. They were unaware of what was happening in the world of robots. Robots were programmed by a certain special human to perform tasks and obey orders as slaves.

A wise robot takes on the role of a sensei, teaching a group of young and enthusiastic robots how to code. Through engaging lessons, the small robots learn about programming concepts in python.The robots are notorious but the sensei is determined to teach them coding.
